The user can login into the application via the Login button at the top right corner of the page. The user MUST use their Google account to log into any account, and their Google account can only be associated with one account at a time. If the user's Google account is not already associated with an account on the site, a patron account with their Gmail is made for them the first time that they log in. 

Note that if the user presses the back arrow after logging in without login out, another login attempt will trigger a Third-Party Login Failure because the user is already logged into one of their accounts. It is strongly recommended that all users log out before logging in again. Also note that if the user leaves the page before logging out, then when they reopen the application, they will be automatically logged into the last account they were logged into when they left. 

After the user successfully logins in, the Login button changes to an Account button, which redirects the user to their Account dashboard, where they can view their Profile, Bookings, Reviews, and Collections. 

On the Profile page, all users can view their first name, last name, username, and email, as well as the date that they joined and the last time they logged in. Users can also change their profile photo. 
Note that users are given a default photo when their account is first made, once they change it, they cannot delete their photo or change it back to the default photo unless they delete their account. 
Also note that users are not able to delete their account. 

are four different user types you have to consider:
Anonymous users: users that will go to your CLA that do not have accounts and want to look around with limited access
Patrons: users that have accounts in the CLA and will have a login (through Google), a profile, and can request to borrow various items
Librarians: users that have accounts in the CLA and will have a login (through Google), a profile, can borrow various items (same as Patrons), but also have the ability to add new items and collections to the CLA
Django administrators: users who have access to the Django Admin page through the Django login system (do not have to use Google login) and have no access to the app (e.g., they cannot borrow items)
We will refer to CLA users that have accounts (Patrons and Librarians) as “regular users.” Regular users DO NOT include anonymous users (because they cannot login to the system) or Django administrators (because they ONLY have access to the Django admin page, and not the CLA itself).
Regular users must only login through Google login and NOT through the Django login system. CLAs SHOULD NOT provide a Django login page for regular users.
CLAs must provide a separate login page for Django admin users. This page is typically auto-generated by Django and is at the /admin URL. Teams are welcome to customize this page if they want. Regular users should not be able to login to the Django admin site.
All CLAs must incorporate cloud storage through Amazon S3 to handle file uploads. No uploads should be stored in Heroku as they will be deleted when your dyno is restarted! Also no files should be stored in the PostgreSQL database as this is generally bad practice. Application data, such as users, items, collections, etc. will be stored in the PostgreSQL database using Django’s model infrastructure.
All projects must be built using the prescribed language (Python 3), database system (PostgreSQL), framework (Django 5), build environment (GitHub Actions CI), source control management (GitHub), cloud hosting (Heroku), and cloud storage (Amazon S3). No exceptions to these will be granted.
Note: All projects must use the PostgreSQL database engine for production on Heroku and continuous integration (on GitHub Actions). You are allowed to use SQLite for local testing so you do not have to install PostgreSQL on your own machine, but another option is to change your settings.py file point to the PostgreSQL DB on Heroku at all times.
All CLAs should have a footer on each page that indicates that this system is a class project, the system is not monitored, and no real information should be submitted. If appropriate, direct the user to an appropriate external resource.
