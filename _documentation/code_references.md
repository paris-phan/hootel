# AI Assistance Notice

_Last updated: 2025‑04‑29_

## Python files
- Some functions and business logic reference online resources; inline comments cite the exact sources next to any borrowed fragment.

## HTML / CSS
- Various HTML/CSS lines were written with assistance from Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
- Most of this help is limited to styling: utility-class combinations, layout tweaks, and other visual formatting.
- The model did **not** generate multi-line algorithms, backend logic, or complex JavaScript.

- AI generated most/all body paragraphs & texts displayed on the site.

## Design Inspiration
- **Aman Resorts**: Minimalist grid, full-bleed hero images
- **Hermès**: Warm earth-tone palette (`#9D5248 #F7F5F1`), generous whitespace

## Media Assets
- Most media assets (images, videos) were artificially generated by Sora specifically for this project
- Sample prompts used:
  - "square 1:1, cinematic shot of sandstone courtyard in high desert, rammed-earth walls glowing at late-afternoon sun, long shadow lines, single olive tree in sculptural planter, tranquil reflecting pool, warm ochre + taupe palette, ultra-clean composition, no text, no people"
  - "cinematic gimbal push-in along elevated teak boardwalk, glossy leaves dripping with dew, open pavilion ahead with infinity pool reflecting sky, warm early-morning light shafts, tranquil atmosphere, 24 fps, 4 seconds, soft depth of field"
- Some hero and gallery photos were downloaded from Aman resort press pages for demo "Destination" entries
- All assets are stored in a private development bucket and will be removed before any form of public release

## Naming Homage
- Project slugs reference Aman resorts (e.g., Telpulo → Amanpulo, Telkila → Amankila)
- Names are placeholders only and do not imply endorsement or affiliation
