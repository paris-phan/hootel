We all have tons of stuff in our rooms, our homes, our offices (seriously, look at Sherriff’s office sometime… it’s full of video games…) that we might not use all the time, but others would love to borrow. Your teams are going to be building <em>cataloging and lending applications</em> that can be used for any type of thing you want. Maybe you’ll focus on books and have your app scan barcodes to look up information from an online database. Or perhaps you’ll do the same thing with your video game collection. Another option is tools - hammers, wrenches, screwdrivers, etc. - that you want to keep track of. There are numerous possibilities here! The main thing to consider is it has to be something that you 1) have a “collection” of in some capacity and 2) can lend out to other people. It will be up to your team to figure out what your app will do for your particular set of users.</p> <p>From here on, we will use the following terminology and abbreviations:</p> <ul> <li>The team projects for CS 3240 will be collectively called “Cataloging and Lending Apps” (CLAs)</li> <li>Any individual thing that will be cataloged and made available for people to borrow will be called “items.” Example: if you are doing a book lending app, each copy of a book would be considered an item.</li> <li>A grouping of items will be called a “collection.” Example: you decide to make a collection of all your video games that have Mario as a main character.</li> <li>A “library” will be the full set of all items in your CLA. So, a library will have [0 to many] items and [0 to many] collections.</li> </ul> <h2 id="base-requirements"> <a href="#base-requirements" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="base-requirements"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Base Requirements </h2> <p>All CLAs <strong>must</strong> meet the base requirements listed below.</p> <ol> <li>All CLAs must incorporate Google user accounts as the primary way that someone logs into the system. You will need to use the Google account API to make this work. There are several libraries that are built for Django to work with Google accounts with tutorials.</li> <li>There are four different user types you have to consider: <ul> <li>Anonymous users: users that will go to your CLA that do not have accounts and want to look around with limited access</li> <li>Patrons: users that have accounts in the CLA and will have a login (through Google), a profile, and can request to borrow various items</li> <li>Librarians: users that have accounts in the CLA and will have a login (through Google), a profile, can borrow various items (same as Patrons), but also have the ability to add new items and collections to the CLA</li> <li>Django administrators: users who have access to the Django Admin page through the Django login system (do not have to use Google login) and have no access to the app (e.g., they cannot borrow items)</li> </ul> </li> <li>We will refer to CLA users that have accounts (Patrons and Librarians) as “regular users.” Regular users DO NOT include anonymous users (because they cannot login to the system) or Django administrators (because they ONLY have access to the Django admin page, and not the CLA itself).</li> <li>Regular users must only login through Google login and NOT through the Django login system. CLAs SHOULD NOT provide a Django login page for regular users.</li> <li>CLAs must provide a separate login page for Django admin users. This page is typically auto-generated by Django and is at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/admin</code> URL. Teams are welcome to customize this page if they want. Regular users should not be able to login to the Django admin site.</li> <li>All CLAs must incorporate cloud storage through Amazon S3 to handle file uploads. No uploads should be stored in Heroku as they will be deleted when your dyno is restarted! Also no files should be stored in the PostgreSQL database as this is generally bad practice. Application data, such as users, items, collections, etc. will be stored in the PostgreSQL database using Django’s model infrastructure.</li> <li>All projects must be built using the prescribed language (Python 3), database system (PostgreSQL), framework (Django 5), build environment (GitHub Actions CI), source control management (GitHub), cloud hosting (Heroku), and cloud storage (Amazon S3). No exceptions to these will be granted. <ul> <li>Note: All projects must use the PostgreSQL database engine for production on Heroku and continuous integration (on GitHub Actions). You are allowed to use SQLite for local testing so you do not have to install PostgreSQL on your own machine, but another option is to change your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">settings.py</code> file point to the PostgreSQL DB on Heroku at all times.</li> </ul> </li> <li>All CLAs should have a footer on each page that indicates that this system is a class project, the system is not monitored, and no real information should be submitted. If appropriate, direct the user to an appropriate external resource.</li> </ol> <h2 id="core-use-cases-and-features"> <a href="#core-use-cases-and-features" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="core-use-cases-and-features"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Core Use Cases and Features </h2> <h3 class="no_toc" id="items"> <a href="#items" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="items"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Items </h3> <ol> <li>Items are the “primary objects” in the CLA. They must contain, at a minimum: <ul> <li>Title</li> <li>A primary identifier (e.g., a QR code, a barcode, a key value the user makes or is generated by the system, ISBN, UPC)</li> <li>Status (e.g., checked-in, in circulation, being repaired, etc.)</li> <li>Location (e.g., home library, work library, etc.)</li> <li>Description</li> <li>Representative images (can start as a default image provided by system, but Librarian can add [0 to many] files uploaded to Amazon S3)</li> <li>Ratings and comments posted by Patrons about the item, implemented as part of the CLA (i.e. not using an external app)</li> <li>[0 to many] Collections it is a part of</li> </ul> </li> <li>All patrons can see all items that are NOT in a collection</li> <li>We anticipate that there will be other fields for your items based upon your chosen domain. These requirements will come as a part of your requirements elicitation.</li> <li>When an item is deleted, all information stored in the PostgreSQL database and all files stored on Amazon S3 should be deleted as well. Items cannot be recovered after they have been deleted.</li> </ol> <h3 class="no_toc" id="collections"> <a href="#collections" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="collections"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Collections </h3> <ol> <li>Collections are a group of items that a Librarian <em>or Patron</em> puts together based on some theme. <em>(UPDATED)</em></li> <li>Collections must contain, at a minimum: <ul> <li>Title</li> <li>Description</li> <li>[0 to many] Items</li> <li>Public or Private setting <em>for Librarian created Collections only - Patron Collections are always public</em> <em>(UPDATED)</em></li> <li><em>Creator</em> <em>(UPDATED)</em></li> <li>If Private, a list of users that have the ability to see this collection and borrow items (note that librarians can always see all collections)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Items can belong to more than one public collection at a time.</li> <li>If an item is in a private collection, it is only allowed to be in that one private collection and no other collections, either public or private.</li> </ol> <h3 class="no_toc" id="libraries"> <a href="#libraries" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="libraries"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Libraries </h3> <ol> <li>Libraries must be searchable by any user, based upon their access requirements (see user requirements below).</li> <li>Users can search for items by title and any appropriate keyword or tagging that your app implements.</li> <li>Users can search for any collection by title and any appropriate keyword or tagging that your app implements.</li> <li>Users can search within any collection for items title and any appropriate keyword or tagging that your app implements.</li> </ol> <h3 class="no_toc" id="anonymous-users"> <a href="#anonymous-users" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="anonymous-users"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Anonymous Users </h3> <ol> <li>The CLA shall allow an anonymous user to browse all items that are not in a collection and all items in public collections, but not private collections.</li> <li>Anonymous users cannot see the titles of private collections at all.

Each role has different responsibilities, but ALL ROLES require that you be an active contributor to the code of the project. In other words, if you take on Scrum Master, that doesn’t mean you don’t have to contribute as much code as someone else. Please see the <a href="/syllabus.html#assessment-and-grading">information on Assessment and Grading</a> for more information.</p> <p><strong>Scrum Master</strong> - The Scrum Master could also be called the Team Leader, but it’s not really a “leader” position, per se, in that they are not making major decisions about the project itself. The Scrum Master is responsible for keeping everyone on track, facilitating all team meetings, and monitoring team status / issues. The course staff will come to the Scrum Master first if there are any team issues or questions, and similarly the Scrum Master needs to know what’s going on with the team and can communicate with the staff if someone is falling behind, etc.</p> <ul> <li>Reasons to be the Scrum Master: You like keeping schedules; you like keeping things organized; you don’t mind being the point of contact with the staff.</li> <li>Reasons not to be the Scrum Master: You are not the most organized person; you don’t think you can stay on top of what the team is working on; you don’t like talking to the staff.</li> </ul> <p><em>Major Artifact</em>: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17CmFsw0EBXDCaf_jyibRn0fyT8usLlVwsJcoPZnFoP4/edit?usp=sharing">Scrum Master Final Report</a>, due at the end of the semester</p> <p><strong>Requirements Manager</strong> - The Requirements Manager is responsible for keeping up with the features of the project. This person will take the lead on the requirements elicitation process (which takes place in the first couple weeks of the project) as their major activity. Note that the Requirements Manager doesn’t do the whole process - they just lead the effort. Everyone else has to participate as well! Then throughout the semester they will manage the feature/issue tracker in GitHub, monitoring the state of the project.</p> <ul> <li>Reasons to be the Requirements Manager: You are interested in learning how requirements are created; you want to find out what your fellow students are excited about with your project; you like knowing “what’s coming next” in the project.</li> <li>Reasons to not be the Requirements Manager: You have no interest in interacting with other people to find out what they want in a system; your first couple weeks of the semester are super hectic and you don’t have the time for the elicitation process.</li> </ul> <p><em>Major Artifact</em>: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/184939b91qXL5XsR3YxPN3VpGDEHGJ6dx-1tllwuxSqo/edit?usp=sharing">Requirements Elicitation Document</a>, due within the first few weeks of the semester</p> <p><strong>Testing Manager</strong> - The Testing Manager is responsible for ensuring that the system is thoroughly tested, for developing the overall testing plan/philosophy of the team, and spearheading the beta testing effort at the end of the semester. The Testing Manager is responsible for executing beta testing at the end of the semester and creating the Beta Testing Document. The Testing Manager is also responsible for overseeing the testing philosophy throughout the semester, ensuring unit tests are being written. Note that the Testing Manager does <em>not</em> write every test case in the system - they just keep up with what everyone else is doing and lend support as needed.</p> <ul> <li>Reasons to be the Testing Manager: You want to learn more about testing procedures; you love seeing that unit test result bar turn green; you took HCI or something similar and are interested in setting up user testing.</li> <li>Reasons not to be the Testing Manager: You don’t see the value in writing tests; you don’t want to work with your fellow students in doing in-person testing.</li> </ul> <p><em>Major Artifact</em>: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/153hR7UOOxCLHd6AZH68nYhg-HLS6JEWUr2P3zrgMWkg/edit?usp=sharing">Beta Testing Report</a>, due near the end of the semester</p> <p><strong>DevOps Manager</strong> - The DevOps Manager is the support tech for the team in a sense. They are responsible for the management and support of all the systems we are using in the class, namely GitHub, GitHub Actions, Amazon S3, and Heroku. They should be a person that is relatively comfortable tinkering with computers and settings. The DevOps Manager does not have to have all the answers, but would be the contact person for going to the staff to get help on any particular issues. The DevOps Manager does need to have access to a credit card for setting up the various accounts for the team.</p> <ul> <li>Reasons to be the DevOps Manager: You are familiar with the tools mentioned already, or you are really interested in learning more about them; you like to tinker with settings to get things working “just right”; you have the patience to help those on your team who might need assistance getting their environments working.</li> <li>Reasons not to be the DevOps Manager: You do not feel comfortable helping others with technical issues; you are very unfamiliar with the tools above and would rather just have a “turnkey” solution for doing your work this semester.</li> </ul> <p><em>Major Artifact</em>: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eupWAMVItEcAQyex45NsrI9MprU7iG6S3WHwNTVer2o/edit?usp=sharing">DevOps Report</a>, due near the end of the semester</p> <p><strong>Software Architect</strong> - Midway through the project, a requirements change will be introduced to the base requirements listed above. The job of the Software Architect is to determine how to implement the change, document the steps that need to be taken, and then help the team implement the change. The Software Architect is <em>not</em> the primary coder for the project and should not be treated as such.</p> <ul> <li>Reasons to be the Software Architect: You enjoy solving a puzzle using critical thinking and you are interested in how software is put together.</li> <li>Reasons not to be the Software Architect: You hate troubleshooting code.</li> </ul> <p><em>Major Artifact</em>: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FqpRSalxwvioVi9oJw-DtsrEHVW_gTo_N5sqX-wYoXU/edit?usp=sharing">Requirments Change Analysis</a>, due after the requirements change is introduced</p> <p><strong>Sixth Team Member</strong> - If your team has 6 members, the member without a role listed above should come to office hours with the professor to discuss options. The role will be determined based on interest and needs of the team.</p> <p><strong>Only Four Team Members</strong> - If your team only has 4 members due to the number of students in the course or because a student drops, the role that should be left out is <em>Software Architect.</em> All other roles must still be filled. A team with 4 members <em>does not</em> have to submit the Requirements Change Analysis document, but will still implement the change.</p> <h2 id="artifact-document-templates"> <a href="#artifact-document-templates" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="artifact-document-templates"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Artifact Document Templates </h2> <h3 class="no_toc" id="team-documents"> <a href="#team-documents" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="team-documents"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Team Documents </h3> <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VunaACHIt9-xRZ_Lqo-0s0_Po5fHXaeNrQn7XC1jjh8/edit?usp=sharing">Sprint Report</a> <br /> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gf_WWZYTXk6g076Q4IG2Lr0OXk_-6SG5CGvany-MJb8/edit?usp=sharing">Final Submission Pledge</a></p> <h3 class="no_toc" id="scrum-master"> <a href="#scrum-master" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="scrum-master"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Scrum Master </h3> <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17CmFsw0EBXDCaf_jyibRn0fyT8usLlVwsJcoPZnFoP4/edit?usp=sharing">Scrum Master Final Report</a></p> <h3 class="no_toc" id="requirements-manager"> <a href="#requirements-manager" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="requirements-manager"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Requirements Manager </h3> <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/184939b91qXL5XsR3YxPN3VpGDEHGJ6dx-1tllwuxSqo/edit?usp=sharing">Requirements Elicitation Document</a></p> <h3 class="no_toc" id="testing-manager"> <a href="#testing-manager" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="testing-manager"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Testing Manager </h3> <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/153hR7UOOxCLHd6AZH68nYhg-HLS6JEWUr2P3zrgMWkg/edit?usp=sharing">Beta Testing Report</a></p> <h3 class="no_toc" id="devops-manager"> <a href="#devops-manager" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="devops-manager"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> DevOps Manager </h3> <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eupWAMVItEcAQyex45NsrI9MprU7iG6S3WHwNTVer2o/edit?usp=sharing">DevOps Report</a></p> <h3 class="no_toc" id="software-architect"> <a href="#software-architect" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="software-architect"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Software Architect </h3> <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FqpRSalxwvioVi9oJw-DtsrEHVW_gTo_N5sqX-wYoXU/edit?usp=sharing">Requirments Change Analysis</a></p> <h2 id="sprint-information"> <a href="#sprint-information" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="sprint-information"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Sprint Information </h2> <p>For each sprint check, your team must meet the minimum requirements shown below for each sprint to earn full XP.

Once you have a good set of user stories / issues / tasks for your team to work on, add these as Issues to your GitHub Issues page on your team’s repository.</p> <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> The team must have a “reasonable” set of user stories / issues in GitHub Issues to begin with (around 10 is a lower-bound target). We do not expect you to have your final set of features at this point. However, you need to be able to show the TA that you have gathered requirements data and that you have converted at least some of this information into GitHub Issues. The Requirements Manager will receive a separate score for the requirements document, which is due by the date indicated in Gradescope.

(100 XP will be awarded after Sprint 6 for your Beta version and the remaining 150 XP will be awarded by the professors after final demos.) Like the other assessments in this course, grading is overall holistic - that is, there is no specific point-for-point breakdown for the rubric. One reason for this is that this is simply not how software is delivered in real-life. There are basically only four outcomes:</p> <ul> <li>You meet the expectations of the customer within reason and both parties are satisfied with the outcome;</li> <li>You exceed the expectations of the customer, potentially generating more good will, a good reference, or more future business;</li> <li>You do not quite meet the expectations of the customer, leaving some room for improvement;</li> <li>You ship a system that simply does not work to the expectations of the customer.</li> </ul> <p>We will grade your projects in a similar vein, with some flexibility for minor adjustments.</p> <p>Thus, the grading levels will be:</p> <ul> <li>Above and Beyond - Min XP: 250 / Max XP: 255</li> <li>Complete - Min XP: 200 / Max XP: 250</li> <li>Lacking - Min XP: 150 / Max XP: 200</li> <li>Insufficient - Min XP: 0 / Max XP: 150</li> </ul> <p>Aspects that will determine the exact grade within a range include but are not limited to:</p> <ul> <li>UI design</li> <li>Overall flow of application</li> <li>Special features</li> <li>Obvious bugs that should have been corrected</li> <li>Polish</li> </ul> <p><strong>Final Team Evals:</strong> All team members will complete a final, overall team evaluation at the end of the course. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSel6l86e_xMFlRPbDL3tnIUGPZX2tG3mDld02EjOwN8T2kzbA/viewform?usp=dialog">Final Student Team Sprint Evaluations</a>.
